# Front Screenshot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HuasoFoundries/front_screenshot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HuasoFoundries/front_screenshot)

This library bundles [HTML2Canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) and [Canvg](https://github.com/canvg/canvg)
to transform SVG into images or Canvas elements, and take screenshots of your page or sections of it, even if
they are hidden due to CSS properties such as overlay scroll, hidden or auto.

**WIP** no documentation on the API yet, so if you use this package, you'll have to figure yourself how to use the exposed methods.

## Install

```sh
npm install front_screenshot

or, if you're using [JSPM](https://jspm.io):
